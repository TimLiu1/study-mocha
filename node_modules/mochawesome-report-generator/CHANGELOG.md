# Changelog

### [2.2.2] / 2017-07-07
- Fix an issue where `actual/expected` was being rendered in the CodeSnippet for non-diff code
- Fix an issue where the suite header was not being rendered for root suites with tests

### [2.2.1] / 2017-06-30
- Enable inline diff rendering when using CLI. [#42](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/42)

## [2.2.0] / 2017-06-29

#### Updated / New
- Render inline diffs when using mocha's `--inline-diffs` option [#39](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/39)
- Set the default option for how hooks should display via the `showHooks` option [#41](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/41)
- Add a new `context` display option for hooks which will only show hooks if they contain context [#41](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/41)

#### Bug Fixes
- Don't apply syntax highlighting when `context` is an object and `context.value` is a string [#40](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/40)
- Various display issues [#36](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/36) [#38](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/pull/38)

### [2.1.1] / 2017-06-26
- Remove `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` from CodeSnippet component. [#34](https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome-report-generator/issues/34)

## [2.1.0] / 2017-06-08
- Add support for displaying before and after hooks

### [2.0.3] / 2017-05-09
- Add support for rendering context with `undefined` or `null` value 

### [2.0.2] / 2017-04-25
- Update package.json to spec `fsu` to `^1.0.2` which fixes compatibility with node 4

## [2.0.0] / 2017-04-19
- Add support for multiple files via CLI
- New options: `overwrite` and `timestamp`

#### Breaking
- Change default `reportFilename` from `mochawesome` to same as input filename

Prior to 2.0.0, the default report name was `mochawesome`. Now the default report name will be the same as the input filename. Example:
```sh
$ marge test/sample-data.json

# before 2.0.0 => mochawesome-report/mochawesome.html
# after 2.0.0 => mochawesome-report/sample-data.html
```
You can still use the `--reportFilename` flag to set the filename of the generated report.
